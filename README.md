### [Recruitment](recruiting-exercises/recruiting-exercise-1/Program.cs)
Recruiting students to the test group. We have never dealt with testing, as the leader of this group I wanted to see who would be using inconvenient data for testing. My goal was also to see who is outlawing the code and expects security in different activities. Their task was to look at the code, list some extreme data that were to be tested and possibly quickly tell where the program would be defective.
